When it comes to structuring a React.js application, there are several best practices to follow that can help improve organization, maintainability, and scalability of your codebase.

## ðŸ™ƒ Basic Folder Structure

Use a flat structure for small projects: For smaller applications, a flat folder structure can be sufficient, where you can have components, styles, assets, and pages in the same level directory.

## ðŸ˜Š Intermediate Folder Structure

Follow a component-based architecture: Create separate folders for components, containers, and pages. Components folder should contain small and reusable components. Containers folder should contain components that have stateful logic and interact with external data sources. Pages folder should contain components that represent a full screen or a route in your application.

## ðŸ˜‡ Advanced Folder Structure

Separate concerns based on feature or function: Divide your application into smaller modules based on their feature or function, and group them in folders with clear and concise names. For example, you can have folders for authentication, user management, dashboard, etc.

Use an index.ts file to export modules: Use an index.ts file in each folder to export the modules from that folder. This can help to simplify imports and make your code more readable.
